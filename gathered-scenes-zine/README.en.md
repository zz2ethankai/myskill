> A SMALL PRESS FOR EVERYDAY SCENES.

Gathered Scenes Zine is a collection of image-generation skills for Codex. Instead of applying a fixed visual filter, the skills first read a photograph—its subjects, spatial relationships, color, movement, and emotional residue—then either preserve the scene or distill it into a new paper artwork.

The photograph provides the facts. Art direction decides how they remain.

## How we read a photograph

```text
photograph → observe → extract relationships → choose a path → bind a new page
```

The visual system follows five principles: truthful photography as an anchor, illustration as a field, color as structure, negative space as an active voice, and tactile paper boundaries as material language.

## Two creative paths

| | 实景拼贴 · Gathered Scenes | 影像蒸馏 · Scene Distillation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Best for** | Keeping the source photograph and its identity | Creating a fully independent illustrated artwork |
| **Role of the photo** | A truthful visual anchor in the final poster | Semantic and emotional evidence only; no source pixels remain |
| **Method** | Photography, source-derived abstraction, structural color, and torn paper | Proposition, tension, visual metaphor, paper, color, and authorial type |
| **Skill** | `$scenes-gathered-zine-v1-3` | `$scene-distillation-zine-v1-3` |

### 01 · 实景拼贴 / Gathered Scenes

`scenes-gathered-zine-v1-3` keeps the photograph's irreplaceable spatial relationships. It extends the scene through simplified abstract forms, one high-chroma structural hue, active negative space, and a visible hand-torn fibrous edge.

```text
Use $scenes-gathered-zine-v1-3 to turn this photo into a Gathered Scenes poster.
Preserve the relationship between the figure and the shoreline.
```

### 02 · 影像蒸馏 / Scene Distillation

`scene-distillation-zine-v1-3` does not retain the original photograph in the finished image. It extracts a semantic nucleus, emotional tension, and visual metaphor, then authors a new paper-based editorial artwork.

```text
Use $scene-distillation-zine-v1-3 to reinterpret this photo.
Do not preserve the photograph itself; express “approaching and missing.”
```

## From scene to page

| Stage | What happens |
| --- | --- |
| **01 · Observe** | Locate the core subject, spatial relationships, direction, weight, and quiet areas |
| **02 · Reduce** | Keep the minimum that makes this particular scene recognizable |
| **03 · Translate** | Turn contours, paths, light, material, or emotion into paper-native form and color |
| **04 · Compose** | Build a clear eye path through image, type, boundary, and negative space |
| **05 · Bind** | Deliver a flat, restrained, tactile artwork that stands on its own |

## Scene archive

Representative work is presented as **source photograph → field note → finished poster**, documenting what was retained, removed, and transformed.

### Gathered Scenes 01 · Where Stone Meets Sky

| Source photograph | Finished work |
| :---: | :---: |
| <img src="examples/real-scene-collage/01-where-stone-meets-sky/source.jpg" alt="City and church source photograph" width="440"> | <img src="examples/real-scene-collage/01-where-stone-meets-sky/result.jpg" alt="Where Stone Meets Sky finished work" width="440"> |

The church tower remains a truthful anchor while the dense city becomes a blue printed field across photographic, drawn, and torn-paper boundaries. [Read the field note](examples/real-scene-collage/01-where-stone-meets-sky/)

### Gathered Scenes 02 · Winter Crossing

| Source photograph | Finished work |
| :---: | :---: |
| <img src="examples/real-scene-collage/02-winter-crossing/source.jpg" alt="Winter bridge source photograph" width="440"> | <img src="examples/real-scene-collage/02-winter-crossing/result.jpg" alt="Winter Crossing finished work" width="440"> |

The line of people and its reflection stay photographic as the snowy forest expands into a quiet blue-gray paper field. [Read the field note](examples/real-scene-collage/02-winter-crossing/)

### Scene Distillation 01 · Time Waves Back

| Source photograph | Finished work |
| :---: | :---: |
| <img src="examples/image-distillation/01-time-waves-back/source.jpg" alt="Waving figure and statue source photograph" width="440"> | <img src="examples/image-distillation/01-time-waves-back/result.jpg" alt="Time Waves Back finished work" width="440"> |

The photograph disappears, leaving only the gesture, the distant figure, and a yellow path that turns their unfinished exchange into a metaphor for time. [Read the field note](examples/image-distillation/01-time-waves-back/)

### Scene Distillation 02 · Snow Falls Lightly

| Source photograph | Finished work |
| :---: | :---: |
| <img src="examples/image-distillation/02-snow-falls-lightly/source.jpg" alt="Child in snow source photograph" width="440"> | <img src="examples/image-distillation/02-snow-falls-lightly/result.jpg" alt="Snow Falls Lightly finished work" width="440"> |

The seated posture and winter colors become loose paper fragments; open paper preserves the lightness of snow while a small red form creates a distant reply. [Read the field note](examples/image-distillation/02-snow-falls-lightly/)

## Get started

Clone the repository and copy either or both skills into the Codex Skills directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Zeejay0/gathered-scenes-zine-skill.git
mkdir -p ~/.codex/skills
cp -R gathered-scenes-zine-skill/skills/scenes-gathered-zine-v1-3 ~/.codex/skills/
cp -R gathered-scenes-zine-skill/skills/scene-distillation-zine-v1-3 ~/.codex/skills/
```

Restart Codex if the skills do not appear immediately. Upload a photograph, choose whether to preserve or distill the scene, and invoke the corresponding skill by name.

## Repository

```text
assets/       brand and README media
examples/     curated source-to-result scene archives
skills/       installable Codex skills and interface metadata
```

Source photographs are used only as references for the requested generation. They should not be browsed, shared, uploaded elsewhere, or saved unless the user explicitly asks.

## Find the author
